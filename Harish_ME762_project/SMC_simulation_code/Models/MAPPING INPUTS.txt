The simulation model inputs are front wheel speed and steering angle.

- DynFlatness generates desired forces on the front tire for tracking,
ForceController_pacejka realises these forces by means of wheel speed and steering angle.

- All the other controllers implements AXController_pacejka which translates
the required longitudinal acceleration into a traction force and then again
into front wheel speed.
